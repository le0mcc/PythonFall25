#### Week 1 Assignment - Leo McClellan
# This assignment will display different uses of various Python fundamental tools. This includes defining and printing variables, combining strings, calculations, and other basic skills.

# 1 Variable Assignment and Data Types
# create variables
company = "Acme Corporation"
founded_year = 1945
revenue = 35.6
publicly_traded = True

# print these variables with their type
print(company, type(company))
print(founded_year, type(founded_year))
print(revenue, type(revenue))
print(publicly_traded, type(publicly_traded))

# 2 Data Type
product = "Laptop"
price = 999.99
# print the data type of the price
print(type(price))

# 3 Integer Operations
# set variables for budget and price and determine the allocation of funds
budget = 1000
monitor_price = 45
monitor_quantity = budget // monitor_price
# this will calculate the remainder of the budget that isn't spent on monitors
remaining_budget = budget % monitor_price
print(monitor_quantity)
print(remaining_budget)

# 4 Float Operations
# this will calculate and print the revenue from the defined variables
unit = 150
unit_price = 49.99
unit_revenue = unit * unit_price
print(unit_revenue)

# 5 String Concatenation
product = "Smartphone"
model = "X"
year = "2023"
# combine the desired strings into the required format
product_info = product + " Model " + model + " (" + year + ")"
print(product_info)

# 6 Comparison Operators
order_total = 17
free_shipping_threshold = 50
# create a boolean for whether or not the order is eligible for free shipping
is_eligible = order_total >= free_shipping_threshold
print(is_eligible)

# 7 Logical AND Operator
is_member = True
days_since_purchase = 3
discount_threshold = 7
# determine if customer qualifies for the discount against the requirements
qualifies_for_discount = is_member and days_since_purchase <= discount_threshold
print(qualifies_for_discount)

# 8 Logical OR Operator
email = "mcclellan2@usf.edu"
phone = "6515554650"
# require that email or phone must not be blank for the sign in variable
sign_in_allowed = email != "" or phone != ""
print(sign_in_allowed)

# 9 Logical NOT Operator
day = "Sunday"
# if the day is not Sunday, it will be open
is_open = day != "Sunday"
print(is_open)

# 10 Exponentiation
revenue_growth = .1
initial_revenue = 1000000
# calculate the revenue to 2 decimal places
projected_revenue = round(initial_revenue * ((1 + revenue_growth) ** 5), 2)
print(projected_revenue)

# 11 Modulo Operator for Even/Odd
# determine if the number is even based on the remainder after being divided by 2
number = int(20)
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("Even")
else:
   print("Odd")

# 12 Type Conversion (String to Integer)
quantity_str  = "12"
quantity_int = int(quantity_str)
price = 25
# if the price is 25, calculate and print the total
if price == 25:
  total = quantity_int * price
  print(total)

# 13 Type Conversion (Integer to String)
# combine the strings to create a report string
product_id = 456
launch_year = 2022
report_string = str(product_id) + "-" + str(launch_year)
print(report_string)

# 14 Type Conversion (Float to Integer)
# convert the cart_total to integer and display it
cart_total = 157.85
discount_amount = int(cart_total)
print(discount_amount)
